## Functionality

The scheduler receives information from the user to organize their day and the list of tasks they have in an optimal order for the user. The information given to the scheduler should contain the starting time of the day and at least four characteristics (attributes) of each task among the seven possible characteristics of a task described below.


    1. id: identifier of the task
    2. description: simple description of the task in text, for example, "Go to the gym"
    3. duration: how long, in minutes, a task takes to be completed
    4. dependencies: list of the tasks that have to be done before this one can be done
    5. fixed_hour: predetermined time of a task to start (constrained)
    6. type: category of a task, between academic ('A'), essential ('E'), and personal ('P' - default)
    7. latest_start_time: the latest starting time of a task 
    8. status: default = 'N' (user will not input)
    9. priority: priority value of the task (computed based on other attributes - user will not input)

As the scheduler is initiated to give the order of the tasks the user gives, each task is initialized with its given attributes. After each task is initialized, the scheduler dynamically computes the priority values of each task based on its type, duration, and number of dependencies and the given conditional utility function, explained in detail in the priority value section. As the initial priorities are computed, the scheduler takes all of them and initializes two empty heaps as the priority queues. In the priority queue, we have the characteristics of a min-heap, which will take the tasks that have fixed_hour as one of their attributes; then, on the second priority queue, we have a max-heap, which will take the 'flexible' tasks, meaning those that do not have a predetermined starting time. Finally, the scheduler runs, and it enters a loop until all the tasks are completed, which in the scheduler will be represented by not having any unscheduled tasks (those that have not been inserted into any heap) or any of the heaps not being empty. The initial current time will be the starting time of the user's day. 

For each iteration, as the loop continues until there are no tasks to be done (the termination condition is reached), the scheduler checks if any of the tasks with a status of 'not started' can now be inserted into the heap. The condition for this to happen is that the task has no dependencies; then, the scheduler will check if it has a predetermined initial time so the task is inserted in the correct heap. Then, as the tasks are ready to be executed in the iteration, it moves on to the possible cases that a task will fit, which determines the final result as if each task fits, they are output in order.
