## About the Project

The objective of this project was to develop a small Flask web application that integrates an IoT device simulated by an IoT platform (Blynk was used). 

The web app serves as a control server to the theoretical device, meaning in the 'Streaming' Page, the user has access to the eletronic device that intends to simulate a robot, in this case, a LED was used that would get the commands from both the web app server as well as the Blynk server to connect to the device by Wi-Fi and be able to turn the light ON and OFF through the computer.
